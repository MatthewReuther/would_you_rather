# would_you_rather
Cohort Huckleberry Ruby Capstone Project

## Project Vision

This will be a small command-line program that asks the user to rank what (of two scenarios) they'd rather do.

Users will be able to add/edit/delete scenarios, as well as take a quiz to make choices between the scenarios.  After taking the quiz, the user can get a list of the things they'd rather do based on the results of their quiz.
